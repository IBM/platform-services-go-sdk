## Installation
The current version of this SDK: 0.4.0

There are a few different ways to download and install the Platform Services Go SDK project for use by your
Go application:

#### `go get` command  
Use this command to download and install the Platform Services Go SDK project to allow your Go application to
use it:

```
go get -u github.com/IBM/platform-services-go-sdk
```

#### Go modules  
If your application is using Go modules, you can add a suitable import to your
Go application, like this:

```go
import (
	"github.com/IBM/platform-services-go-sdk/globalsearchv2"
)
```

then run `go mod tidy` to download and install the new dependency and update your Go application's
`go.mod` file.

#### `dep` dependency manager  
If your application is using the `dep` dependency management tool, you can add a dependency
to your `Gopkg.toml` file.  Here is an example:

```
[[constraint]]
  name = "github.com/IBM/platform-services-go-sdk/globalsearchv2"
  version = "0.4.0"

```

then run `dep ensure`.
